# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is submitted as **Task 2** of my internship at **SystemTron** under the **Generative AI track**.  
In this task, I performed an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** to gain insights into the features influencing passenger survival.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides details on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age, and survival.

### 📌 Key Objectives:
- Handle missing data
- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Visualize relationships between features and survival
- Derive insights from patterns and correlations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Steps

- Dropped the `Cabin` column (too many missing values)
- Removed rows with missing `Embarked` values
- Filled missing `Age` values with median
- Converted `Sex` and `Embarked` columns to categorical types

---

## 📈 EDA Visualizations

- ✅ Survival Count Plot  
- ✅ Survival by Gender  
- ✅ Survival by Passenger Class  
- ✅ Age Distribution Histogram  
- ✅ Age vs Survival (Boxplot)  
- ✅ Fare Distribution  
- ✅ Correlation Heatmap  
- ✅ Survival by Embarkation Port

These visualizations helped identify trends, such as:
- Females had a higher survival rate
- Higher class passengers had better chances of survival
- Age and Fare distributions had notable patterns related to survival

---

## 🧼 Cleaned Dataset Info

- Rows: ~891  
- Features used: `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`  
- All missing values handled properly
